All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

# yo i dont have the code that we're supposed to do this assignment on but i'll answer the ones that i can

1.) Where is the ball's original location?

2.) What are the variables dx and dy?

delta x and y, i.e the change in x and y

3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?

4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?

5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?

update

6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1

makes the delta x negative, reversing the velocity in effect

7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy

updates the ball, the y position is increased by the change in y

8.) What is the width of the window?

SW variable's value

9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:

if the ball is touching the top of the screen

10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad

if the ball is touching the left side of the screen
