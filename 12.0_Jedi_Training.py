3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
1
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
1
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
on_update
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
bounces the ball off of the wall
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
moves the ball up equal to delta why
8.) What is the width of the window?
SW 640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
if the ball has hit the ceiling
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
if the ball hit the left side
