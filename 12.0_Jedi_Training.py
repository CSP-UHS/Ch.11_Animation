All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
        (320, 240)
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
        velocity in the x and y directions
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
        180
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
        -120
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
        on_update and on_draw
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
        inverses the direction of the ball (in the x direction)
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
        it moves the ball in the y direction
8.) What is the width of the window?
        640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
        if the ball has hit the top of the window
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
        if the ball has hit the left border of the window
