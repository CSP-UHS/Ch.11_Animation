All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
SW/2, SH/2 (Middle of screen)
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
Velocity
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
180p/s
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
120p/s
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
onUpdate()
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
flips the horizontal axis of the ballw
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
takes the ball's old position, and adds the momentum to it.
8.) What is the width of the window?
640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
If the ball is too far down it won't go down further
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
If the ball is too far to the left, it won't go further
