5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
Update ball
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
It inversers the balls direction

it Inverses the balls y direction
8.) What is the width of the window?
SW or 640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
It is check to see when the ball should bounce top and bottem
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
