All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
        (320, 240)
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
        Velocity in pixesls
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
        180 pixels / sec
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
        120 pixels/sec
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
        On_update
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
        makes the x velocity the oppposite of what it is
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
        the position equals its slef plus dy
8.) What is the width of the window?
        640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
        seeing if the ball is hitting the top
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
        see if ball is hittig the left side
