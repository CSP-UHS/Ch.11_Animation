All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
320,240
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
Horizontal velocity and vertical velocity.
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
60 pixels/sec
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
60 pixels/sec
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
def on_update
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
Reverses the horizontal velocity
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
Reverses the vertical velocity
8.) What is the width of the window?
640 pixels
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
Its checking if the y position is more than the screen height minus its radius
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
Its checking if the horizontal position is less than the radius
