All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location? 320, 240

2.) What are the variables dx and dy?

3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction? 180

4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction? -120

5.) Which method is run 60 times/second? on_update

6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1 Switches sign on velocity.

7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy Adds velocity onto position of ball.

8.) What is the width of the window? 640

9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:

10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
