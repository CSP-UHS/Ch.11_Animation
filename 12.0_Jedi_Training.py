All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
middle of the screen
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
Velocity horizontal and vertical
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
60 pixels per second (180)
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
60 pixels per second(120)
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
 on update/update ball
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
dx = opposite/make it go in other direction
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
redrawing ball location due to velocity
8.) What is the width of the window?
640 pixels
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
if ball is off screen on y axis
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
if ball is off screen on x axis left side
