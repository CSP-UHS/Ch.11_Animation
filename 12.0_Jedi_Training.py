All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:
1.) Where is the ball's original location?
    320, 240
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
    dx = how fast its gonna move in the x pos
    dy = how fast its gonna move in the y pos
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
    180 pixels/sec
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
    120 pixels/sec
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
    update_ball
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
    change the x direction by -1 every 1/60 second
    changes the direction to oppisit
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
    the y position is adding the dy position
    changing position every frame
8.) What is the width of the window?
    640 or SW
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
    if the y position s is greater than the width of the window minus the radius
    checking the top of the screen
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
    if the x positions is smaller than the radius
