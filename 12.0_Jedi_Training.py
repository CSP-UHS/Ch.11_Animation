1.) Where is the ball's original location?
    self.ball = Ball(320, 240, 3, 2, 15, arcade.color.AUBURN)
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
    dx = change direction by x
    dy = change direction by y
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?

4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?

5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?

6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
    change the x direction
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
    the y position is now set to the y direction
8.) What is the width of the window?
    640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:

10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
