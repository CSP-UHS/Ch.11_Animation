All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
SW/2 and SH/2
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
velocities
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
60 pixels per second
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
60 pixels per second
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
on_update
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
if it is going right, it will make it go to the left
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
moves the position of the ball
8.) What is the width of the window?
640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
if the edge of the ball is at the top
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
if the edge of the ball is at the left
