1.) Where is the ball's original location?
    (320, 240)
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
    direction the ball goes
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
    180 pixels/sec
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
    -120 pixels/sec
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
    on_update and on_draw
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
    changes the direction to the opposite direction
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
    adds velocity to position of ball
8.) What is the width of the window?
    640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
    see where you want it to turn it around on the top of screen
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
    checking if left side of screen is being "hit" by the ball
