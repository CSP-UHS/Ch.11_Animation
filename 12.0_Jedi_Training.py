All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
x = 320 y = 240
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
velocities
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
60
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
60
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
 on update
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
goes oppisite of the horizontal
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
adds the velocities of the ball
8.) What is the width of the window?
640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
it is checking if the object is touching the top of the screen
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
it is checking if the object is touching the left of the screen
