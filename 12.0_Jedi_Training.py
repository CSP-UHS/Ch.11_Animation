All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
Any ball's loacation can be anywhere in the screen. It is the X and Y location.
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
Dx is how many pixel an object is moved in one 60th of a second following the x coordinate.Dy is how many pixel an object is moved in one 60th of a second following y coodinate.
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
The ball can move any pixels/sec in the x-direction. Generally 60 pixels/sec
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
The ball can move any pixels/sec in the y-direction. Generally 60 pixels/sec
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
On_update method is run 60 times/second.
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
The Object will go opposite direction of the dx it is going.
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
It adds the value of dy into pos_y
8.) What is the width of the window?
The width of the window can be any number.
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
It checks the y position of the object if it is more than the value of screen height minus the object's radius.
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
I checks the x position of the object if it is less than the radius of the object.
