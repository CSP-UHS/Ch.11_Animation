All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
        At the center of the window

2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
        The velocity; dx is the velocity going to the right/left, and dy is the velocity going up/down

3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
        180

4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
        120

5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
        on_update

6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
        Moving the x velocity in its opposite current direction

7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
        It moves the position of the ball by incerments of dy

8.) What is the width of the window?
        640 pixels

9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
        Checking if the ball is goung off the top of the screen
        It's checking if half of the ball is off the he top of the window

10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
        If the ball goes past the left side of the sceen
