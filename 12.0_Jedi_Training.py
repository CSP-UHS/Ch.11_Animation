All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
(320,240)
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
Amount the x and y will off set
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
3
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
2
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
on_update
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
make object travel negative to what x travel
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
adds to y the amount of movement the y has
8.) What is the width of the window?
640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
if the edge of the ball's position is greater than screen height minus radius
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
is the position of ball x cordinate less than radius of ball
