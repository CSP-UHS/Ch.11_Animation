All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
320,240
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
speed it moves in a direction
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
180
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
120
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
on_update
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
inverts the number of the x to make it so the ball doesn't go off screen
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
moves ball up at the speed of dy
8.) What is the width of the window?
640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
if the ball is hitting the edge of the screen on the bottom
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
if ball is hitting the edge of the screen on the left
