All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location? (320,240)

2.) What are the variables dx and dy? horizontal (x-direction) and vertical (y-direction) velocities

3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction? 180 pixels/sec

4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction? 120 pixels/sec

5.) Which method is run 60 times/second? on_update

6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1     changes the x-direction of the ball

7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy     changes the position of the ball in the y-direction

8.) What is the width of the window? 640 pixels

9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:     if the radius of the ball in the y-direction is off the screen

10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad     if the position of the ball in the x-direction is partially off of the screen
