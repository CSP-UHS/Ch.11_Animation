2.) Draw four 30px wide side rails on all four sides of the window
3.) Make each side rail a different color.
4.) Draw 30 boxes(squares) of random size from 10-50 pixels
5.) Animate them starting at random speeds from -300 to +300 pixels/second. 
6.) All boxes must be moving.
7.) Start all boxes in random positions between the rails.
8.) Bounce boxes off of the side rails when the box edge hits the side rail.
9.) When the box bounces change its color to the rail it just hit.
