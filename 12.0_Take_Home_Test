HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: Alex Randall
 
All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
    x = 320 y = 240
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
    dx & dy is the speed of change for the respective axis
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
    180 pixels per sec 3*60
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
    120 pixels per sec 2*60
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
    update_ball
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
    Reverses the speed of x, thus making it go the opposite way
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
    adds speed/distance to the y location of the ball
8.) What is the width of the window?
    640px
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
    This code is checking if the ball is "hitting" the top of the window
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
    This code is checking if the ball is "hitting" the sides of the window
